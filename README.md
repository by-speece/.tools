# .tools - Easy Console System Manager for Arch Linux

.tools is a simple manager of your arch linux instance, including tools to quickly fix the most common bugs. It also allows you to easily back up your rice and quickly restore them with the same or different hardware, including dependencies! Of course, you have to manually configure it based on a template. [Link to template soon]

# Depedences

```
whiptail
reflector


```

# .settings module

The .settings module will in the future be connected to the community repository on Github, unfortunately due to my lack of skills, most things have to be done manually, e.g. adding new configurations of the desktop environment etc.
In the near future, I'm going to create a handicapped package manager to easily share system configurations, along with the ability to quickly upload those configurations by users

# Goal of the .tools project

The main goal of the project is to create a user-friendly Arch Linux system manager in order to quickly personalize, restore and solve basic and common problems with this system. As well as the project itself is to facilitate the sharing of people, their so-called "Rice" on r / UnixPorn and other similar places.
